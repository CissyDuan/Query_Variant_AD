# Query_Variant_AD
Code&amp;Dataset of Query-Variant Advertisement Text Generation with Association Knowledge(CIKM2021)

The data set contains search query content of website users and brand information of advertising sponsors. To protect the their privacy, the data set is open-sourced after ID projection, which means that the mapping between word ID and word text will not be open-sourced. This approach allows peers to reproduce our automatic evaluation results and conduct computational experiments, but cannot get the original text information. We believe that the protection of users and customers privacy is the highest priority.
